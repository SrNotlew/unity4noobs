### 1.1 Welcome

The goal of this documentation is to provide some educational material in your language.

We believe that games should be for everyone, and also the game development. We should speak often about "accessible" inside dev area.

Being accessible is not only being free. When I decide to start this project, I was worried to find a way to communicate with different people considering their own learning difficulties. The language barrer, the complexity of some documentations, disfunctions, etc.

This documentation was not develop with the goal to replace the official Unity documentation, but instead complemment and help the newbies, people with learning difficulties and any other that need in a way more didactic.

Unity is a game engine develop by Unity Technologies, current one of the mostly use in the game industry, and offers the possibility of create 2D and 3D games and also export them for different platforms.

A special thanks to MAGE community, my friends, my subs, viewers and to everyone that came, even for a while, and support this project.
