## Comments

 Comments are code lines that will not be executed, in other words, those lines will be visible only during development.

You have two ways to comment your code using C#

```csharp
// using two slashs - comment just one line

/* using slash asterisk 
   comment one or more lines */
```

Comment help you to organize and understand your own code sheet.

```csharp
/* condition to catch a Pokemon */
void CatchCondition(){
//if I have a Pokeball
if(pokeball >= 1){ 
    //so I catch a Chimchar!
    Debug.Log("You got a Chimchar!");
    }
}
```
