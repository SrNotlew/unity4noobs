## 3.2 C# Syntax

Unity uses **C# (CSharp)**, an object oriented programing language **(OOP)**, project and programming software model based on the interaction and composition of *objects*.

## Brackets {}

Você pode identar seu código de duas formas usando brackets:

```csharp
    public static void Mage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The best world's community!");
    }
```

```csharp
    public static void Mage(){
        Console.WriteLine("The best world's community!");
    }
```
## Semicolon " ; "

In C# we use semicolon `;` to declare that we finished one line.

## C# Program Structure


1. ### _Using_
```csharp
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

`using` declare the libraries that will be used in the application.

Let's suppose that you need a history book to do a work so you go at library.
Geting there, you ask about the book to the librarian and he tells you the `path` to find get to the book. So the `using` do almost the same, showing us the path to the desired package.

2. ### _NameSpace_

```csharp
namespace YourGame{
    class PlayerStats{
        
    }
    class EnemyStats{
        
    }
    class GameManager{
        
    }
}
```

The `namespace` is used to organize your application's classes.
