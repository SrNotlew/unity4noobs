## Downloading the Software

You can download Unity in two ways: choosing a specific version or, preferably, downloading **UnityHub** (a launcher that helps you to manage the Unity versions and view all your projects).



You can download [clicking here](https://unity3d.com/pt/get-unity/download).

 ## Licence

After download and install the Unity software you need to validate your licence loggin on **UnityHub** with your account.

Unity got 4 licence plans, one of them being **100% free** for students and companies or enthusiasts whose funds are less than USD 100K in a year (12 months).

You can see the Unity plans with more details [clicking here](https://store.unity.com/pt/compare-plans).

 ## Unity Versions

After validate your licence its time to choose which version you are go to work. Unity is know as your [long update list](https://unity3d.com/pt/get-unity/download/archive), but to make your life easier I highly recommend to choose the **LTS _(Long Term Support)_** versions, that allow a better experience and a stable support.

With **UnityHub** open, you can click at **ADD** button to view the available versions to install.
